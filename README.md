[00:00.17] One, two, three, four
[00:05.48] Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
[00:09.81] Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
[00:14.57] You stepped inside with a vibe I ain't never seen
[00:20.84] Yes, you did, ooh
[00:23.00] So, girl, if you talk like you walk, come and talk to me
[00:31.31] But look here
[00:32.83] It would break my heart, break my heart, break my heart
[00:36.36] If I find out you can't move
[00:42.02] You better show me now, show me now, show me now
[00:46.10] 'Cause when I take you to the floor, ooh, you gotta get down
[00:49.36] You know what to do
[00:50.90] Hey, Mr. DJ (Oh, oh, oh)
[00:54.61] Play a song for this pretty little lady (Oh, oh, oh)
[00:59.17] 'Cause if she dance as good as she look right now (Oh, oh, oh)
[01:03.69] I just might, I just might make her my baby

[01:17.80] Oh, I just might
[01:19.29] But, first, may I just say that your face got me so intrigued?
[01:26.40] I'm so intrigued
[01:29.33] But what good is beauty if your booty can't find the beat?
[01:34.46] I don't wanna know, girl
[01:36.26] So, please don't do that to me
[01:38.10] 'Cause it would break my heart, break my heart, break my heart
[01:41.65] If I find out you can't move
[01:47.26] You better show me now, show me now, show me now

[02:16.92] Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
[02:21.68] Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
[02:24.91] This the part where you break it all the way down, down, down, down
[02:29.68] This the part where I turn you all the way around, 'round, 'round, 'round
[02:34.19] Put some spirit in it, put your heart into it
[02:37.76] That's all I need
[02:39.74] And if I like what I see, you're comin' home with me
[02:42.94] Hey, Mr. DJ (Oh, oh, oh)
[02:46.61] Play a song for this pretty little lady (Oh, oh, oh)
[02:51.24] 'Cause if she dance as good as she look right now (Oh, oh, oh)
[02:55.56] I just might, I just might make her my baby
[02:58.49] I just might make her my baby
[03:01.32] Hey, Mr. DJ (Oh, oh, oh)
