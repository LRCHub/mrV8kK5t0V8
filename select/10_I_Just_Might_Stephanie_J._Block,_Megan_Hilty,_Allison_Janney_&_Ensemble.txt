What to do and where to start,
Things are falling all apart,
Trying hard to move ahead,
But keep losing ground instead.

Still, I have to take a chance,
Putting fear and doubt aside,
Had no warning in advance,
Nothing left to do but try.

And I just might make it work,
I just might make it after all,
I just might rise above the hurt,
Though I've suffered quite a fall.

But I have to get a grip,
Hold onto it like a vice,
Have to face the fallen chips,
I just might make it,
I just might.

You're the one that keeps me strong,
You're the shoulder that I lean on.

Hard to swallow pride...

When I think I've had enough,
I think of you and toughen up.

I know the truth inside.

Love's a weapon and tool.
And I am nobody's fool.

I'm nobody's fool.

I just try to right what's wrong,

And just keep on keeping on.

But I just might make it work.

I just might...

I just might...

I just might make it after all.

I just might make it.

I just might rise above the hurt,
Though I've suffered quite a fall.

Though I've suffered...

Though I've suffered...
I just might live to see the day...

I can say "Hey! I'm all right"

All right...

I'm all right.

All right...

Have to go on either way.

Have to go on...

Rise above it.

I just might be stronger than I know,
Well I might really be surprised,

Gonna get on with my life.

And be strong.

I just might make it,
I just might.

Just might make it.

I just might!

I just might.

I just might make it,
I just might...

Just might make it...

Just might make it...
