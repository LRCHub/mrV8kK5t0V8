One, two, three, four
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,

Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,

You stepped inside with
a vibe I ain't never seen, uh
Yes, you did, ooh
So, girl, if you talk
like you walk,
come and talk to me
But look here, uh
It would break my heart,
break my heart, break my heart
If I find out you can't move, uh
You better show me now,
show me now, show me now
'Cause when I take you to
the floor, ooh,
you gotta get down
You know what to do
Hey, Mr. DJ
(Oh, oh, oh)
Play a song for this
pretty little lady
(Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause if she dance as good
as she look right now
(Oh, oh, oh)
I just might,
I just might make her my baby
I just might make her my baby,
hey
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo
I just might
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo
Oh, I just might
But, first,
may I just say that your
face got me so intrigued?
I'm so intrigued
But what good is beauty if
your booty can't find the beat?
I don't wanna know, girl
So, please, don't do that to me,
uh
'Cause it would break my heart,
break my heart, break my heart
If I find out you can't move, uh
You better show me now,
show me now, show me now
'Cause when I take you to
the floor, ooh,
you gotta get down
You know what to do
Hey, Mr. DJ
(Oh, oh, oh)
Play a song for this

(Oh, oh, oh)
'Cause if she dance as good
as she look right now
(Oh, oh, oh)
I just might,
I just might make her my baby
I just might make her my baby,
hey
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Here's the part where you
break it all the way down, down,
down, down
This the part where I turn
you all the way around, 'round,
'round, 'round
Put some spirit in it,
put your heart into it
That's all I need
And if I like what I see,
you're coming home with me
Hey, Mr. DJ
