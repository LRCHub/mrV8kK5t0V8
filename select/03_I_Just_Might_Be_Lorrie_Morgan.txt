I JUST MIGHT BE
I just might be a pleasant dream, that will haunt you for all time Sometimes peaceful and serene, sometimes tearing at your mind
I might be that scent of perfume, on that pillow where I use to lay
I just might be the best damn thing, that you ever threw away
I just might be a soft caress, that you wish was still around
Just a little happiness, you were lucky that you found
I might be that one I love you, that you meant but wouldn't say
I just might be the best damn thing that you ever threw away
Do you miss me every morning, is the situation sad
Do you wish that it was different, do you realize just what you had
I might be a southern breeze, blowing through tasseled hair
Stirring up old memories, of the time when I was there
I might be tugging at your heart strings
Everytime you face another day
I just might be the best damn thing that you ever threw away
(musique)
I might be tugging at your heart strings
Everytime you face another day
I just might be the best damn thing that you ever threw away
I just might be the best damn thing that you ever threw away
