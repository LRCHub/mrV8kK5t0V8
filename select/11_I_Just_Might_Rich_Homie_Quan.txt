Longway come fuck with me
Longway come fuck with me
Longway come fuck with me
Longway come fuck with me
Longway come fuck with me
Cut it up!

I just might spend a whole milly
I just might throw it to the ceiling
I just might spend a lil dub today
I just might spend a lil twenty
I just might spend a lil million
I just might floss on a billion
I just might come out that broke
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hundred
I might just turn to a stunna
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a Honda
I might pull up in the Honda
I just might get to these bitches
I might go broke with these bitches

Whippin' the dope, rock the pot like a pan
Nigga got the whole rock under my feet, no broke hands
These bitches like willy go crazy, that's why I go crazy like Spaz
Nigga could never be none of you, never, ever, you're not it
Consider us street zoos, you ridin'
With the wooly, lil' Mexico, lingo lingo
Yes I got a whip, but you not included, all because you not cutthroat
Yes I got bales in the pantry, yes I got pounds in the attic
I don't like you, guess I'ma turn my
Head on you like you a lil' faggot
If I ever take a trip to the chain gang
You know they embrace a lil' homie
The warden on me, they pourin' on me
You think it's a dream, you blurry on me
My skin is tatted, you can't tour on it
Matter fact, you can't explore on it
You should go down on your knuckles, my nigga
You're over-exaggeratin', plural on it

I just might spend a whole milly
I just might throw it to the ceiling
I just might spend a lil dub today
I just might spend a lil twenty
I just might spend a lil million
I just might floss on a billion
I just might come out that broke
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hundred
I might just turn to a stunna
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a Honda
I might pull up in the Honda
I just might get to these bitches
I might go broke with these bitches

I just like you, baby girl
I just like you, baby girl
I just like you, baby girl
I just like you, baby girl
I just want you never to stop, shit
I just want you never to stop, shit
I just want you, baby girl
I just want you, baby girl
Don't ever stop, don't ever stop, shit

I just might, I just might, I just might, I just might
I just might, I just might, they say the most
Oh, I dive in the sky, I really believe I can fly
I be like hurry and buy, I fucked 'em both, I'm conniving
I'm an angel in the sky, I look down on the drive-bys
Hundred bands inside of my pants, YSL loaded
I don't like Gucci rings no more, put it up like a trophy on a colon
Smell like flowers, she's the bomb, I just call her lotus
Dick get hard on her butt, my nickname Hokey Pokey

I just might spend a whole milly
I just might throw it to the ceiling
I just might spend a lil dub today
I just might spend a lil twenty
I just might spend a lil million
I just might floss on a billion
I just might come out that broke
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hundred
I might just turn to a stunna
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a Honda
I might pull up in the Honda
I just might get to these bitches
I might go broke with these bitches
