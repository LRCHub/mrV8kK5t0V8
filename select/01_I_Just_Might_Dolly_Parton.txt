I love you, I love you
My heart seems to whisper
But my lips cannot form those words
I know my heart is calling out to you
In a voice you've already heard.

Does your heart feel as if
It could burst any second
Is it racing, will not slow up
If you just want to be with me endlessly
Well I'm thinking we might be in love

We might be in love what else could it be
These feelings of wonder, of passion and romance, excitement and pure ectasy
We might be in love and it might be forever
I think there's a future for us
If you just want to be in and all over me
It might be, we might be in love.

I promise for keeps if you're feeling like me
Then it might be, we might be in love
I dare say we might be in love
